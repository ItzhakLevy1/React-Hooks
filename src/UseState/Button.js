/* 
 The forwardRef function is a higher-order component that allows you to pass a ref through a component to one of its children.
 This is useful when you want to access a child component's DOM node or instance methods from a parent component.
 In this case, the Button component is wrapped with forwardRef, allowing the parent component to access its ref and call its methods directly.
 The useImperativeHandle hook is used to customize the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using ref.
 It allows you to define which properties and methods should be accessible from the parent component.
